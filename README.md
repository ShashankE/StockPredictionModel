# StockPredictionModel

# Usage

To use this program, you will need to run two scripts:

StockModelTraining.ipynb: This script loads and creates a pickle file with the machine learning model. This script only needs to be run once to generate the model.

StockPredictionApp.ipynb: This script loads the trained model and allows you to input any valid stock ticker to train/predict the model off of.
You can run these scripts using Jupyter Notebook or any other similar environment.

Alternatively, you can run the program through the following link on MyBinder:

# About

This program is designed to help people new to the stock market to learn and minimize losses through the use of machine learning. The program predicts the stock prices of any valid stock ticker using a trained machine learning model, which can be used to make informed trading decisions.

# Research

My research involved collecting and analyzing vast amounts of historical data on stock prices, as well as identifying the most suitable machine learning algorithms and techniques for training the model. The research also involves investigating factors that influence stock prices, such as market trends, global economic conditions, and company news, and incorporating them into the model.

Furthermore, the research process also involves evaluating the performance of the model to ensure that it provides accurate predictions. This involves testing the model on a range of historical data sets and comparing its predictions to actual stock prices. The model's performance is then optimized by fine-tuning its parameters and adjusting its algorithms. By conducting extensive research, the stock prediction tool using machine learning can provide traders with more informed predictions of stock prices, thereby enhancing their trading strategies. Also learned about the machine learning process itself, with gradient decent and neural network layers/training.

The stock prediction tool using machine learning can be a valuable resource for new traders in the stock market. By providing more informed predictions of stock prices, the tool can help traders to make better decisions about when to buy and sell stocks. It can also assist in minimizing losses and identifying potential opportunities for investment. Moreover, the tool's ability to provide insights into the factors that influence stock prices can help traders to develop a better understanding of the stock market and make more informed decisions in the future. Overall, the stock prediction tool using machine learning can provide new traders with a valuable resource for enhancing their knowledge and performance in the stock market.
