# StockPredictionModel

# Usage

To use this program, you will need to run two scripts:

StockModelTraining.ipynb: This script loads and creates a pickle file with the machine learning model. This script only needs to be run once to generate the model.

StockPredictionApp.ipynb: This script loads the trained model and allows you to input any valid stock ticker to train/predict the model off of.
You can run these scripts using Jupyter Notebook or any other similar environment.

Alternatively, you can run the program through the following link on MyBinder:

# About

This program is designed to help people new to the stock market to learn and minimize losses through the use of machine learning. The program predicts the stock prices of any valid stock ticker using a trained machine learning model, which can be used to make informed trading decisions.

# Research

This project involved a significant amount of research into the stock market and machine learning techniques. The goal was to create a program that would be useful for people who are new to trading and want to learn how to make informed decisions about buying and selling stocks.

The research involved gathering and analyzing large amounts of historical stock data, as well as studying various machine learning techniques and algorithms. The goal was to find the best machine learning approach for predicting stock prices and develop a model that could be easily used by traders.

The result of this research is a powerful tool that can help new traders to learn and minimize losses. By using the program to predict future stock prices, traders can make informed decisions about when to buy and sell, increasing their chances of success in the stock market.
